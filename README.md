# Applihero
A web app that uses a personalized RAG model on a user’s resume/background to coach them through job applications. The app lets users upload resumes and create job-specific “sessions”. For each application, Applihero provides unique advice, generates survey answers and cover letters, and includes a simple feedback module (ratings + comments).
